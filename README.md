# MovieRecommendersystem

This project is done as a part of assignment in edx course - ML with Python 
We have two kinds of Recommendation system -
a) Content Based -  Based on user's history of ratings and likeability, we suggest a new movie to user 
b) Collaborative Filtering - two types
      1)User based - If both users 1 and 3 like same movies movie-1 and 2 , We recommend on basis of this 
      2)Item based - If movies 1 and 3 are liked by person 1 and 2, the we consider as neighnour movies (similar). Now, we recommend movie 1 to person 5 since he already liked                        movie 3
